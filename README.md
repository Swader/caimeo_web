# Caimeo Framework

The Caimeo Framework is a modern, local-first, decentralized, single-point-of-failure-resistant framework for NFT-enabled AI Agents which have pluggable and modifiable "brains", attributes, skills, attitudes, and more.

Every AI agent is an ERC-6220 NFT, and can contain other ERC-6220 NFTs, which are equippable into certain slots. Every AI agent can level up, and once leveled up it can gain more slots on its non-transferable "brain" NFT, like another skill slot, or another personality trait.

Some equippables are tradable and movable, some are cloneable (as in, learning from someone), and some are non-transferable (as in, they are a part of the agent's "brain").

The framework is designed to be modular, so that new equippables can be added to the system easily, and the system can be extended to support new use cases.

All the NFTs are backwards compatible with ERC-721, so that existing NFTs can be used in the system, but they are easiest to trade on the GBM-auction-enabled and modular-NFT-friendly royalty-enabled Singular.app marketplace.

The official Caimeo collection starts with Soul Shards, which will evolve using ERC-5773 asset replacement into fully fledged AI agents.
